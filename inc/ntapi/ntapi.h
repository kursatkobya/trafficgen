/**
 * @brief Initializes the NTAPI library
 *
 * This function <em>must</em> be called prior to any other
 * NTAPI function. It will initialize the NTAPI library and perform
 * compatibility checks based on the version applied.
 * The version is used to indicate to NTAPI what version of the API the
 * application supports and will enable NTAPI to act on this and adapt to that
 * version of the API if possible. This means that if the application is compiled
 * to e.g. version 1 of the API and the current API is version 9, NT_Init will
 * check if it is possible to enable backward compatibility to version 1 and
 * thereby allow the application to run on a version 9 library with version 1 API.
 *
 * @param[in] version  The version that the calling application supports
 *
 * @retval  NT_SUCCESS     Success
 * @retval  !=0            Error
